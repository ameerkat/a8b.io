            <a name="summary"></a> 
            <p>The first thing you see in a code review is usually some author specific summary of changes. Specific teams sometimes have templates for their summaries which are nice to make sure that you address the important questions your team might need to know and are a good way to make explicit the priorities of the team, but aren't critical. <span class="highlight">Code review summaries should be clear, short, concise and give relevant background information for someone coming in with minimal context. As an author your goal is to minimize the back and forth that can stem from a lack of understanding around your code or the code it's based on.</span> Include links to other code, commits or documentation that your code is based on. If your summary is huge, seems vague or abstract then perhaps there's too much code in your code review. The best way to prevent this as an author is to think about this consciously when writing the code. <span class="highlight">Define (to yourself) what ticket/issue/feature/etc. you're going after when coding and keep your work scoped to that.</span> Use granular, meaningful commits so you can easily separate work if it grows too big. If you want to start on another piece of work, then make a new branch! If you know there's going to be a lot of work under one specific feature once you look at it a little deeper then try to break it down into sub-tasks. Keeping your work scoped is the easiest way to ensure others will readily and quickly review your work.</p>

            <a name="user"></a> 
            <p>As a reviewer think about how the consumer of the code will use it, be it the end customer of the product or a service calling an API. <span class="highlight">Is there anything that seems cumbersome, wonky, or unintuitive from the user's perspective?</span> Does this API method have a param called timeout that's an int with no documentation? Is the most common user action nested in 3 windows of dialog? If it's a minor implementation detail then add a suggestion. If it's something more systemic then add a comment with your feedback and make sure you call out they should create an issue for it and you're not expecting this to change right away. In theory code reviews are more about implementation details than high level user interactions, but in practice a lot of times minor details or last minute changes that can have a big impact are left up to the programmer. <span class="highlight">When validating an API design try to think about it from the perspective of at least 2 consumers.</span> Thinking about varying use cases will validate that the abstractions are generic enough. APIs are hard to change once published, and other developers can spend significant time interacting with them and won't have the same context that you do, so they're important to get right.</p>

            <p class="side-note">As a reviewer it's important to let the author know what you think is critical (blocking the CR from being approved by you) and what you are just being "nit picky" about. Some code review applications have a mechanism to indicate the type of comment you're adding. A lot of times you can also just prefix your suggestion with the literal words "nit" or "minor". It doesn't really matter as long as it's clear to the author. It's important to distinguish between critical and non-critical comments because it gives the autonomy of prioritization to the author. If the author disagrees with those non-critical suggestions, that discussion can happen offline in an asynchronous manner and is not blocking the code from progressing if it needs to. Those non-essential changes can be ranked and prioritized (and even delegated) considering all other work the author needs to do. It's important as an author that you establish a pattern of following up with all review items and don't let minor items fall to the side.</p>

            <a name="correctness"></a>
            <p><span class="highlight">The most important thing you're looking for code wise in a code review is correctness. If you only leave one type of comment, this is the one to leave. Ensure that the code does what it says it does, and won't do anything else unexpected.</span> Ensure that the code has proper exception handling and monitoring so that you'll know when things do go wrong. You're looking for missed edge cases, potential bugs, things that will wake you up at 2am if you're on call. As an author look to use or establish patterns that mitigate risk. Things like the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">circuit breaker</a> pattern can help avoid thrashing downstream dependencies and propagating timeouts and define standardized fallback behavior. Hidden assumptions are a commonly overlooked thing which may result in bugs later. If you make an assumption about the way something is being used now but don't validate it, someone else might come along and misuse it later. This has the potential to get overlooked because people will assume the changes are low risk since the dependencies have been in production for so long and the context for the assumption may have been lost by then. <span class="highlight">Look for tests to affirm correctness. If there are no tests then look for what the author manually tested, they should be telling you in the code review summary. Since tests are important, testability is another important attribute the code should have.</span> A lot of time the ability to add tests with a code review will depend on the amount of previous testing done that has been established as a precedent. If the author needs a day or two to set up the test framework and all the helpers then they should decouple this work. However it's my opinion that they should do that as soon as possible as this will prevent others from compounding technical debt as well which I would classify as fairly important.</p>

            <a name="futureproof"></a> 
            <p>Look for how the code will handle change in the future. Things you might want to consider are how many users are there going to be for the foreseeable future, how fast will that number change, and how will their use cases potentially change? How hard is it to make those theoretical changes? I see scalability and modularity as a spectrum. Unscalable code is hard to adapt. <span class="highlight">Extremely scalable code doesn't need to be able to scale when shipped, but there needs to be a simple and clear path to making it scale up when it needs to.</span> In the same way, your abstractions don't need to be super granular. But you need to be able to easily refactor to make them so when required. Your code should be modular and easily separable.</p>

            <a name="readability"></a> 
            <p>If you had to come back at a later point how easy could you figure out what the code is doing, enough to change it? Naming of things should be self descriptive but as concise as possible. Watch for redundancy or type information in the name. Keep methods short (able to fit on a single screen) and self descriptive. The type information should come from the code. If you're putting type information in a class name to differentiate one class from another consider differentiating them more or if it serves a similar purpose consider generics/templates and combining the two classes. I like to use explicit types in all languages over implied types (e.g. avoiding var in C# / Java / Scala and using the type name explicitly), simply because this makes things more searchable when not using an IDE, i.e. in a code review, when looking things up in online tooling, looking at git diffs, doing a text search, etc. Suggest inversion of if statements to avoid nesting if it makes sense. Generally avoid unecessary nesting. Make sure you can follow the code easily. <span class="highlight">As a reviewer if some part of your code is confusing or complicated then add a code review comment asking for the author to add a code comment, don't just ask them what it does! That context will be lost and if you don't understand it now you won't understand it later.</span> In my opinion code comments that are not docstrings should be a last resort if reasonable otherwise the code should be refactored to make it more self explanatory, think about how you could restructure the code to make it more readable before resotring to a comment.</p>

            <p class="side-note">If you make a suggestion, don't write the same thing in 20 different places. Being on the receiving end of those kind of comments can be frustrating. As a reviewer and an author try to fix the problem systematically. If it's a style thing, consider creating an IDE settings file that can be shared among the team. If it's a code issue that comes up frequently, consider writing a git hook or a linting rule so it will show up as a warning or an error if necessary. In any case as a reviewer if you see a problem multiple times call out to the author to fix it everywhere and give helpful tips and details how. Teach a man to fish and stop throwing your fish all over his code!</p>

            <a name="kiss"></a> 
            <p>My favorite point that gets the least attention in my opinion is to ensure the code is keeping things simple. The code should have the ability to change in the future, but should be short, concise and self documenting right now. Watch for unecessary "cruft". Follow the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a> principle. <span class="highlight">Don't write things before you need them, just make sure you can add features on top of what you write. Ensure things that are likely to change are more extensible, and make sure the author spent less time on making the rest so. Not everything should be built to the same standards, one size fits all is not the most efficient method of execution.</span> Make sure the author does not repeat themself! A good rule for keeping things simple is if something is used twice then it should be abstracted up (e.g. if it's a chunk of code, make it a method. If it's the same method in two or more classes, then move it to its own class).</p>

            <p class="side-note">Sometimes I'll come across code with too many extremely thin layers of abstraction that aren't keeping things simple. When the implementations are thin and numerous you end up with a very fragmented system that is more difficult to learn and change than it would have otherwise been. The best way to counter that is to combine grouping single responsibilities in one class with keeping things simple. Keep code that changes together, together! You may be tempted to further break down your code into a more complex class structure but unless you need that point of flexibility now or in the foreseeable future, keep the code together.</p>

            <a name="ignore"></a>
            <p>Like I said earlier one size does not fit all, and one set of suggestions for what to look for in code reviews does not fit all teams. Use your best judgment. See below for a good example when these suggestions might fail.</p>

            <p class="side-note">Technical debt piles up when the author (or the team as a whole) never gets around to those optional suggestions and improvements even though they are important. If they aren't important then discuss this and cut them from the work backlog. If you realize they are important and then all the sudden decide to do them, then the fact that you haven't got around to them is a lack of proper (explicit) prioritization. However it's quite possible to have a "tragedy of the commons" where everyone's self interest in shipping new features (perhaps one's that look good on reviews) outweighs the true needs of the product. In cases like these priorities are skewed and the system or the process needs to be heavier weight and more prescriptive.</p>
