                    <h3>Choose something meaningful</h3>
                    <p>You'll feel a lot better than picking things for the financial gain. This is more about why you do things than what you do. There's also a baseline of livability that you'll need to maintain.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Always do the highest impact thing</h3>
                    <p>And always do it first. This means if presented with the opportunity to say help one person, instead think about how you could scale that up to make it easier to do the same thing for thousands of people, through a change in process. Instead of writing one piece of code tucked away in your system, if it might be useful then make it a library.</p>

                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Do high cognitive load things in the morning</h3>
                    <p>Like making important decisions. You'll be at your best. Do things that you want to matter in the morning. Do big decisions, and things that require lots of will power should be done in the morning.</p>
                    <p><i>Corollary: Do your grocery shopping in the morning. You'll have the willpower to make the healthiest choices.</i></p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Do high cognitive load things in the morning</h3>
                    <p>Like making important decisions. You'll be at your best. Do things that you want to matter in the morning. Do big decisions, and things that require lots of will power should be done in the morning.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Change your environment to reflect your decisions</h3>
                    <p>When you want to implement a decision like eat more fruit. Rather than buying fruit and hoping to choose it over say chips, instead make fruit more accessible. Put pieces of fruit around the house so they're always the easiest choice to make.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Turn implicit decisions into explicit ones</h3>
                    <p>This is especially pertinent to priorities and the bias of “Mental accounting”. People are bad at intuition for things without immediate feedback.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Use goals you can win with every day</h3>
                    <p>If you have a large goal work backwards from it to split it up into a winning system or tiny achievable subgoals so you can have frequent wins.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Don't be afraid to fail</h3>
                    <p>And write down those failures. A successful idea may take 1000 attempts. Make sure the amount of effort you put into something is worth the pay off. Think about the expected value of each attempt based on the payoff. Every failure you make now is a failure you've avoided in the future with potentially even bigger stakes. Explicitly understanding your failures will also make you more valuable in an interview situation.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Take notes on things you learn or read</h3>
                    <p>This let's you evaluate them more explicitly, and makes it easier to recall at a later time when you can apply them. Try not to be too selective with the way you summarize ideas. Don't just write things down that agree with what you know.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Use (vivid) imagery over words when you want people to remember things</h3>
                    <p>This applied to learning for yourself and when attempting to teach others</p>
                </li>
                <li class="principle-item">
                    <h3>Always be learning</h3>
                    <p>This is an investment in yourself. Think of knowledge as a network and producing something new requires drawing connections between ideas in that network. In this case the value of this network increases exponentially with each new idea. Reading is a great way to learn new things at your own pace.</p>
