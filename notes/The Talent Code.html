            <h3>Notes</h3>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>To learn the most and become expert at something, put yourself on the path which you will make the most errors that you can recognize and correct.</li>
                <li>Look for people to imitate and external signaling, the more you resemble the person you are imitating the better. The primal cue "you are not safe" is extremely powerful as an external signal.</li>
                <li>A good coach knows how to make the right circuit fire at the right time, repeated firing of the right circuit builds intuition/muscle memory.</li>
                <li>Working on what you think will be a lifelong activity or towards a lifelong purpose will result in more dedication on your part.</li>
                <li>Being in a nice <i>easy</i> place makes us complacent and less motivated, avoid what is nice and easy.</li>
                <li>Reward yourself and others for genuine effort, not for "intelligence".</li>
            </ul>
