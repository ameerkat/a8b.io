            <h3>Notes</h3>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Hard work and perseverance is possibly a myth perpetuated by selection bias. It's not about luck, there is a process that can engineer a good startup.</li>
                <li>5 Principles of the Lean Startup<br />
                    <ol>
                        <li>Entrepreneurs are everywhere</li>
                        <li>Entrepreneurship is management</li>
                        <li>Validated learning</li>
                        <li>Build-Measure-Learn Loop</li>
                        <li>Innovation accounting</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The lure of good plans, solid strategy and thorough market research leads to failure because startups have too much uncertainty. Just do it doesn't work as a strategy either.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1: Start</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li class="highlight">Lean startup asks people to evaluate their productivity not just in case or features but with learning, which is harder to measure.</li>
                <li>You're driving a car not launching a rocket. This driving process is the build-measure-learn loop, steer by choosing to pivot or persevere.</li>
                <li>Companies have a vision, which results in strategy to achieve vision via the product. The vision usually doesn't change but the strategy might.</li>
                <li>Expect to fail and have to adapt, learning is an acceptable result.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2: Define</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Startup, innovation, entrepreneur are broadly defined, can also be inside an existing corporation.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Innovator's Dilemma: people are good at creating <i>sustaining</i> innovation but struggle to create <i>disruptive</i> innovation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3: Learn</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li class="highlight">Traditional planning puts all your eggs in one basket, what if you're building something no one wants?</li>
                <li>Lean strategy focuses on validated-learning which is not after the fact rationalization.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Value in a startup is what contributes to learning, anything that does not contribute to learning is a waste.</li>
                <li>Most of the time customers don't know what they want in advance. Synthesize vision with what customers will accept. Sometimes you have to reach down to bring the product to the customer.</li>
                <li>True startup productivity: systematically figuring out the right things to build.</li>
                <li>Zero invites imagination, small numbers numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize</li>
                <li>Don't engage in "success theater"</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4: Experiment</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li class="highlight">If you cannot fail, you cannot learn.</li>
                <li>Think Big, Start Small. Test a big idea in a small way, e.g. when Zappos was starting up they went to a local shoe store, took pictures of the inventory and put them online. They promised they would come back and buy the shoes at full price if they sold them online.</li>
                <li>Observe real customer behavior through data as opposed to hypothetical questions (e.g. on a survey)</li>
                <li>Value and growth: does the product deliver customer value and how will new customers discover the product.</li>
                <li>Find the early adopters, not the average customer</li>
                <li>Even if customers complain about lack of features, etc. an experiment can still be a success if you can gauge that customers are actually interested in the product.</li>
                <li>Try to minimize your total time through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5: Leap</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Test your assumptions as quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>Be careful of analogies to previous technologies and successes, make sure you aren't skipping over assumptions.</li>
                <li>Analog is something that confirms assumptions, antilog is an example that would go against your assumptions. e.g. in the case of the iPod, The walkman was an analog that people would want to listen to music on headphones in public, Napster was an antilog that people would be willing to buy and pay for music online.</li>
                <li>In the beginning, aim to define a customer archetype to humanize the proposed customer. Use that to guide day to day decisions.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Avoid analysis paralysis, e.g. either a just do it attitude due to impatience or being paralyzed in an endless loop of analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>6: Test</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Minimum viable product helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible. It's not the smallest product possible, rather the fastest way to get through the build-measure-learn loop.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Early adopters accept an 80% solution</li>
                <li>Most people dramatically overestimate the features required for a minimum viable product.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Avoid overbuilding and overpromising</li>
                <li>Dropbox needed to create an MVP for seamless file transfer, because that was hard to do in a prototype they did it via a video.</li>
                <li>We must set aside our traditional professional standards to start the process of validated learning as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>Do not give up at the first sign of trouble, iteration is key.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>7: Measure</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li class="highlight">The myth of perseverance is so dangerous because we choose to ignore the writing on the wall</li>
                <li>Startups are too volatile for forecasts and milestones to be accurate</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_analysis">Cohort analysis</a>, one of the most important tools of startup analytics.</li>
                <li class="highlight">Hard work doesn't matter if you're working on the wrong thing.</li>
                <li>Don't improve raw numbers, improve the yield of each cohort. You can have a hockey stick and still not be making improvements. Use "actionable metrics".</li>
                <li>A-B testing is great</li>
                <li>One way to focus importance on every part of the cycle of story development is by limiting the number of items in each state (backlog, in progress, completed, validated), this constraint will force everyone to think about the story from the perspective of how to validate it.</li>
                <li>Processes lay the foundation of a healthy culture</li>
                <li class="highlight">
                    3 A's of metrics
                    <ul>
                    <li>Actionable - Must demonstrate clear cause and effect</li>
                    <li>Accessible - Make reports as simple as possible so that everyone understands them, use cohort-based reports</li>
                    <li>Auditable - Data must be credible</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>5% of entrepreneurship is the big idea, 95% is the gritty work measured by innovation accounting</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>8: Pivot or Persevere</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>People get stuck in the land of the living dead, companies that experience just enough success to stay alive, but not living up the expectations of its founders and investors.</li>
                <li>Pivots
                    <ul>
                        <li>Zoom pivot: focus on one part of the existing product</li>
                        <li>Customer segment pivot: changing the audience focus</li>
                        <li>Platform pivot: pivot the whole platform</li>
                        <li>Zoom-out pivot: opposite of the zoom in pivot</li>
                        <li>Customer Need Pivot: discover the customers care about something else</li>
                        <li>Value Capture Pivot: change the monetization or revenue model</li>
                        <li>Engine of Growth Pivot: there are three primary engines of growth, viral, sticky and paid.</li>
                        <li>Channel Pivot: sales channel pivot</li>
                        <li>Technology Pivot</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Assess pivot or persevere often. Failure to pivot is a common problem as the decision to pivot is difficult.</li>
                <li>Lean Startups practice just-in-time scalability</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>9: Pivot or Persevere</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Single piece flow is a batch size of one. e.g. folding 100 letters, putting them all in envelopes, and sealing all 100 envelopes vs do all 3 tasks to make a single completed ready to mail envelope 100 times.</li>
                <li>"Single-piece flow" is faster than batch flow for the envelope case</li>
                <li>In process oriented work like this, individual performance is not nearly as important as the overall performance of the system.</li>
                <li>Single piece flow tells us if there's something wrong with any component immediately. Immediate feedback on quality is important to quick operations.</li>
                <li>Everyone is stuck on large batches as the traditional siloed way of working.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>10: Grow</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Sustainable growth is characterized by one simple rule: New customers come from the actions of past customers.</li>
                <li>Churn (what % of customers fail to remain engaged) offsets growth rate</li>
                <li>If growth is already high but churn is also high, then find a way to keep customers engaged.</li>
                <li>Product/market fit is the ability for the market to "pull" out the product</li>
                <li>Engines of growth can run out when the target audience becomes saturated.</li>
                <li>Getting the early adopters requires a different strategy from getting the average customer</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>11: Adapt</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>You have to balance planning with suffering a technical failure which would potentially end you (e.g. the friendster effect)</li>
                <li>Management likes to take the middle approach with a "split-the-difference" approach to planning which ends up incentivizing a polarized behavior in employees</li>
                <li class="highlight">Use the five whys to incrementally adjust your process, this refers to asking why five times to get to the human root cause of any problem</li>
                <li>Make a proportional investment into fixing the root cause e.g. if the root cause is the need for employee training but the problem wasn’t big then make a small investment into employee training and see where it goes</li>
                <li>Don’t turn the five whys into the five blames</li>
                <li>Be simple and specific in the investigation, try to address small enough categories of problems not large general problems</li>
                <li>Make sure you get everyone connected to the problem in on the inquiry, this also avoids the five blames</li>
                <li>Appointing a single person responsible for driving the five whys meetings can be effective</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>12: Innovate</h4>
            <ul class="notes">
                <li>Budgets need to be accurate but also secure</li>
                <li>Teams should be fully cross functional</li>
                <li>Take a personal stake in the outcome of your creations</li>
                <li>Focus on establishing rules under which autonomy can be achieved</li>
                <li>Create a sandbox for innovation</li>
                <li>What you innovated will eventually become the status quo on the team, sandboxes will grow into the whole product and you will have to create new innovation teams internally. It becomes hard to not split the difference and hold to your tested ideas.</li>
                <li class="highlight">"There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all" - Peter Drucker</li>
            </ul>
