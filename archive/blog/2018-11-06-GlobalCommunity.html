                So I've seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rINpjy808o">trailer for "The Mule"</a> (involuntarily) twice now. There's a quote that stuck out to me from the narrator, it goes 
                <blockquote>Family's the most important thing. Don't do what I did. I put work in front of family. I thought it was more important to be somebody out there than the failure I was in my own home.</blockquote> 
                This got me thinking about the anecdotes about how <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/03/top-5-regrets-of-the-dying_n_3640593.html">people on their deathbeds wished they worked less and spent more time with friends and family</a>. This association is not wholly undue to the fact that clint eastwood is looking real old in this trailer. It takes a special kind of person to take true fulfilling joy out of ambition or arbitrary success alone. Family and friends are generally more fulfilling than succeeding at your role in the workplace, whether you participate out of a sense of duty or for personal achievement.

                Humans are social creatures. We thrive on social interaction and find great purpose in a sense of community. Which is why the sterile, stack ranked, competitive modern workplace is such a contrast. A large status is put on career progress and growth, as people's desire to be climb the career ladder (personal success) is their main interest. Let me contrast that with how I've been thinking and living my life recently.

                I also watched Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70243590">netflix link</a>) recently and another quote stuck out to me there. <blockquote>The way that we're going to ratchet up our species, is to take the best and to spread it around to everybody so that everybody grows up with better things.</blockquote> I find that quote really meaningful because it shows the spirit of what Steve Jobs was trying to do at Apple. Steve Jobs was an incredibly successful man who for the most part did not care as much for success itself, but for the company and for the products he was building. When he demanded perfection, he did it for the product, not for himself. He did it because he truly believed those products would advance society as a whole in a meaningful way. This is what I call <b>craftsmanship for a global community</b>. Through your work you can create a meaningful connection to society as a whole by having a purpose higher than yourself. When you are creating a product, you're making it the best it possibly can be not to advance your career, or for the praise and delight of a particular customer, but to shape and advance the future of society as a whole. That is why I work on what I work on, and no longer on ecommerce widgets. When you have this higher sense of purpose success is no longer arbitrary. Success is essential, not for the rush of dopamine or the glory of self achievement but to fulfill the promises of tomorrow. There is a burden upon us to create it as best as we can. A long night working towards a goal isn't a "work-life tradeoff" or a "necessary evil to get ahead", it's something you feel almost compelled to do, to build a better future. Busy work and working for works sake falls away. Doing work just to look good no longer matters. "Good enough" is no longer. When I am on my deathbed I do not think I will wish I worked less, but I hope I will look back at all the things I did and can be proud of why I did them and how I shaped the present as the past's future.
