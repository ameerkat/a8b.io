                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <div class="description small">a8b is a blog and site focused on Artificial Intelligence, System Architecture, and Software Engineering. 
                        In general I will try my best to avoid purely motivational or fluff pieces, most content will be technical and focused on the areas above.
                        My goal for this site is to collect and simplify knowledge to share with others, usually through the lens of the projects I'm currently working on.
                        My goal in life is to build and productize advanced artificial knowledge systems which can be used to automate or vastly simplify most mechanical and repetitive "information worker" type tasks.
