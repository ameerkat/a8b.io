## Overview
In this post I'll walk through analytics tools that are designed for monitoring web3. I'll stick to tools crafted more towards non-fungible blockchain data (ETH, SOL, etc.) rather than cryptocurrency market technical analysis (e.g. tools for doing TA on bitcoin prices). I'll go over the biggest competitors in the web3 analytics space that are operating today, and what sets them apart.

### Motivation
As I shared on [the IndieHackers Nifty Analytics project](https://www.indiehackers.com/product/nifty-analytics), I'm building something in this space that hopefully provides a bit more context into how these communities interact rather than just providing analytics into pricing or trading metrics. I'm not a fan of focusing too much on what competitors are doing when building something, but I do think it's important for understanding the domain.

## Dune
[Dune](https://dune.com/home) is probably the biggest champion of the space at the moment, [having raised ~$70 million earlier this year](https://news.bitcoin.com/web3-data-platform-dune-analytics-propels-to-unicorn-status-after-69-4-million-fundraise/).

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/dune-main-page.jpg "The main page of the Dune website has a very 'bitclout' feel. Minimalist, monospaced, emoji driven.")

The main thing that sets Dune apart from most of the competitors in the space is user generated content. Users can create and share dashboards freely as well as open them up and 'view source'.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/dune-dashboard-example.jpg "Dashboards in Dune can contain fixed graphics and text, or dynamically calculated graphs and metrics.")

Graphs and charts are constructed from a SQL like syntax, the not-so-secret *spice* of Dune if you will, that you can get from any of the blocks by clicking on the chart or metric title. An example query is below.

```
SELECT
    source,
    SUM(vol_usd),
    COUNT(vol_usd)
FROM (
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN sv3."senderWallet" = '\xc590175E458b83680867AFD273527Ff58f74c02b' THEN 'Metamask'
        ELSE 'Web App'
    END as source,
    "signerAmount" / 10 ^ p.decimals * p.price as vol_usd
FROM airswap."Swap_v3_evt_Swap" sv3
left join prices.usd p on p.minute = date_trunc('minute', evt_block_time) and p.contract_address = sv3."signerToken"
WHERE 
    CASE
        WHEN {{time}} = 'Day' THEN evt_block_time > now() - interval '1 day'
        WHEN {{time}} = 'Week' THEN evt_block_time > now() - interval '1 week'
        WHEN {{time}} = 'Month' THEN evt_block_time > now() - interval '1 month'
        WHEN {{time}} = 'Year' THEN evt_block_time > now() - interval '1 year'
    END

) as vol_tx
GROUP BY 1
```

The goal of Dune then seems to provide analytics for what's happening on chain, in a transparent, shareable, and modifiable way. It has a very open source feel. The pricing similarly reflects that, with Dune Pro letting you keep private dashboards, export data, and remove watermarks as well as increased priority and parallelization for queries.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/dune-pricing.jpg "Fear is the mind killer... And I'm afraid the pro price tag has just murdered my brain.")

Unlike a lot of the other tools that boil down to "pricing technical analysis" or "rarity scouting" tools, Dune lets you ask your own questions and get interesting answers (which I like). This isn't a tool that is necessarily well suited for exploring individual NFTs or tracking how rare that gold necklace on your cat faced dolphinâ„¢ is, but it's not trying to be. The documentation seems fairly robust at a glance and outlines the [data structure of their tables in detail](https://docs.dune.com/data-tables/data-tables/raw-data/ethereum-data). They support xDai, Ethereum, and Solana data as well as exchange pricing data for a wider variety of tokens. Unlike NFT specific analysis tools, Dune lacks system level structured "metadata" around NFT projects (such as who runs it, what's their discord or twitter, rarity, etc.) that some other tools in this list attempt to capture. Users can always construct dashboards that bring in this data in a fixed manner, or even [add this data themselves to user generated tables](https://docs.dune.com/data-tables/data-tables/user-generated).

### Summary
Dune is an open analytics platform to build, share, and remix dashboards for pricing/exchange data and on chain data for xDai, Eth, and Sol. Its strong open source ethos is what sets it apart.

## NonFungible
Capturing that premo domain, [NonFungible](https://nonfungible.com/market-tracker) positions themselves as a market tracker for NFTs.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/non-fungible-nft.jpg "Individual Monke on NonFungible")

As you might notice, similar to OpenSea they provide collection level aggregate stats as well as individual NFT level data, including tags. The tags seem to vary by collection, for example crypto punks just provides a list of combined tags rather than specific attributes.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/non-fungible-nft-crypto-punks.jpg "Cryptopunk is just a bag-o-tags")

In all honesty it's hard to see what differentiates this over OpenSea or whatever market platform you use itself. They have quarterly and annual "NFT reports" which sit behind an email capture. While I won't repost any part of the report here since I've agreed not to by checkbox, it does seem to be a nicely formatted PDF that looks a bit like an annual report for a publicly traded company. The report seems to be primarily market distribution/segmentation and financial data for NFTs as a whole. As a company they seem to be using their market data and reports as a means to drive traffic to their consulting services.

### Summary
NonFungible treats NFTs more like traditional financial assets providing "your dad's" PDF reports and high level charts focused on market and individual asset price action and metadata. Nicely presented but not a lot of substance, acts as a funnel for their consulting services.

## Moby
Straight off the bat, compared to the other analytics platforms [Moby](https://moby.gg/) seems to be ahead of the game when it comes to actually finding emerging NFT projects. You're able to find things as they're minting rather than after they start trending on the exchange. It's hard to describe but the things trending on OpenSea for example seem to be projects which now are expensive, whereas projects trending on Moby seem to be projects that are gaining traction.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/moby-main-page.jpg "Moby main page trending NFTs")

Most of the site is blocked for non-subscribers, or limited to 1 hour update intervals. Subscriptions run at 0.1 ETH for 6 months ($275 at the time of writing, or ~$46/month).

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/moby-pro-blocked.jpg "Moby, let me in. *cries in Eric Andre*")

This is a tool built for active traders of NFTs, or people looking to find the hot new thing a day or two before everyone else. In a way it's exciting (heck, I got excited about something just researching for this article). Moby is a real-time NFT screener that can identify trends in real-time, and even has implemented their own Limit Orders system you can use based on your own screeners. Unlike other tools you can see what is actively minting, and this tool appears on lists as a mint tracker as well.

### Summary
Moby is a real-time NFT market trend analysis tool that looks like it's built for active traders or people seriously scoping out what's emerging.

## Ayzd
![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/ayzd-project.jpg "Ayzd project view")

Probably one of the more "different" things on this list, Ayzd seems to focus on acting as a metadata repository for NFT projects. Ayzd shows very rudimentary twitter metrics (just the follower counts), founding team members, and a project score projected onto a radar chart. They break each project down into scores for Utility, Uniqueness, Community, Team, Viral Potential, and Visual Quality. It is not possible to filter or rank by these scores in the project listings. Searching for a few things I found on Moby, the catalog seems to be somewhat incomplete (not a scientific assessment).

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/ayzd-stats-web.jpg "Ayzd out here treating your collection like a D&D character.")

What makes Ayzd kind of unique is that they don't provide any transactional data at all. They do provide mint calendars and news. It's nice to see web3 communities treated as communities, but Ayzd certainly falls a little short in depth of analysis.

### Summary
Ayzd is an extensive but somewhat incomplete catalog of NFT projects and metadata. They have an opinion on each project ranking various attributes such as Viral Potential and Community, however they don't show their work.

## NFTGO
[NFTGO](https://nftgo.io/) is an analytics tool for NFTs that is probably closest to Moby on this list. Top mints for example shows you what's popular being minted in the last 15 minutes. There's so many graphs and charts that it can be overwhelming figuring out what to look at. NFTGO probably provides the most extensive list of metrics out there. In addition a lot of their sites is centered around tracking "whales" and their activity, as well as correlating users who hold "blue chip" NFTs. You can see what whales have traded, minted, or hold and everything related to whales is flagged throughout the site.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/nft-go-top-mints.jpg "Top mints in the last 15 minutes on NFTGO")

Unlike others on this list, NFTGO has rich rarity data that can be viewed at the collection and individual NFT level.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/nft-go-rarity-data.jpg "Collection level rarity data for Azuki")

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/nft-go-individual-rarity.jpg "Azuki#5558 rarity metrics")

In addition NFTGO publishes some research reports which are just blog posts essentially (e.g. "Does Rarity Affect the Price of Blue Chip NFTs?" and "Six Key Trends Happening Right Now on Blue Chip NFTs"). NFTGO is a great blend of rarity metadata, transactional data, as well as some unique data on holders.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/nft-go-holder-data.jpg "Protect the whales")

To top it all of NFTGO seems to be completely free at the moment.

### Summary
NFTGO is one of the most comprehensive platforms for NFT analytics available, and it's free. They provide near real-time and correlated transactional, rarity, and holder data.

## OpenSea ðŸ¤”
[OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) itself does provide rudimentary information related to pricing data and transaction volume.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/open-sea-ranking.jpg "High level NFT ranking data on OpenSea")

You can explore OpenSea transactional data such as listings, bids, sales, etc. on specific chains or projects via the stats section of their site. Most of this data is available in aggregate via their APIs as well, which are freely queryable (for example [collection floor price data](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/retrieving-collection-stats)) within certain rate limits.

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/open-sea-transaction-data.jpg "OpenSea sales and bids data for the infamous monkeys")

OpenSea is the biggest NFT marketplace by far. If you know anything about NFTs, and you're looking for high level aggregate data that is freely accessible then you're probably already there. OpenSea warrants being on this list because they are *well-positioned* to provide richer analytics on top of their on-chain and in-house transactional data. They are currently looking for [candidates to do this very thing as a "Web3 Community Data Scientist"](https://jobs.lever.co/OpenSea/4a60deca-6c25-42cd-958c-f5e8707b6583).

![](/images/survey-of-web3-analytics/open-sea-job-do.jpg "OpenSea looking for community data scientists to do analysis including off chain social data such as twitter and discord")

### Summary
As the big dog in the NFT world, OpenSea may leverage their position to expand the stats they offer. Job listings indicate they are looking to get richer community insights that include off chain data. Whether they intend to open that analytics infrastructure is yet to be seen.
