What makes a good community online? This is an interesting question, particulary with in the context of web3. Web3 is inherently distributed and decentralized by definition. Communities exist on many platforms, and are an amorphous multi-faceted blob that can be hard to formalize (as compared to maybe a webforum that is more easily trackable). Good communities have a great "vibe" but it can be hard to pinpoint what that actually means. As an individual it can be overwhelming to discover or evaluate those communities and projects. There are attributes of a "good" community that are highly personal, and there are attributes that are more universal. Let's look at some of them.

Slightly related but for those interested we've taken a look at some of the [existing analytics platforms out there for web3](./survey-of-web3-analytics) in the previous article.

## Mission, Authenticity & Focus
Almost all web3 communities have goals fueled by a mission of the project creator(s), usually expressed as a *project roadmap*. In the worst case this is something like making money off eachother. While that can be the case for a lot of projects out there today a lot of them have larger goals or missions. Whether or not you resonate with these missions can be highly personal. At the end of the day, if you're joining a community to accomplish a mission it's usually better *accomplished without an NFT*. Like when most new tools come out there is a phase of over application. There are very few communities that truly use the NFT technology in a way that enables something core to their mission. Still, NFTs provide a catalyst to enable a community to be motivated to come together.

### Examples
Let's get a feel for some missions by looking at examples.

#### MushyBaras

Let's take a look at MushyBaras, one of the project's that is minting as I'm writing this article. Their goal is plastered on their site *to fight climate change together*. I personally *love* this mission, but not how the project plans to go about implementing it. We can evaluate their authenticity and focus by how true they stay to their mission and how intentional they are about executing it. The roadmap can tell us a lot about what kind of project this is.

While the vibe of the community, and the actions of the individuals can support the mission we mainly judge the ability of the project to execute the mission by the plans of the community leaders. The concrete action that MushyBaras takes to execute their mission is giving 5% of sales to a Tropical Forest Charity. It's hard to see how anything else they plan on doing is going to support that mission directly. Are the people in this community good? Is there a lot of hype? Maybe. If your goal is to support the mission this one might fall a little short though. A 5% contribution sounds *more like* a corporation making a pledge than a not for profit aimed at pushing the cause forward. The point of this article is not to roast NFT projects however, rather to show that the mission of the project can be executed and supported in different ways.

#### Metaverse Players

Metaverse Players is a NFT collection supported by the platform House of First. House of First aims to be a "House of First is a platform for cultivating and uplifting compelling voices and extraordinary talent". They seem to find creators and enable them to create Web3 communities.

Metaverse Players is an NFT project from Butcher Billy who is an experienced and aware winning contemporary pop artist. Their roadmap outlines their goals with the project. They plan to introduce a mechanic called nft re-roll which allows you to reroll your NFT up to 3 times, have an in person party, a "companion" NFT, a vague promise of games, puzzles, prizes etc and the hopes to expand. There is a clear playful nature to the whole thing, but the mission is never stated or clear. At the end of the day this is an art project, which many NFT collections are. You buy them because you value being a part of the community, but it's not clear what the community is like.

### Summary
This leads me to my summary which is the stated mission of most Web3 communities is a lot less important than the members of the community and the way they interact. A lot of these communities are based around subjective art projects. As someone familiar with the corporate world I have a strong belief in mission and principles as a way to drive autonomy across a large group of people. But it's unfair to judge these inherently distributed less-hierarchical communities in the same way. As far as I can tell the stated mission and roadmap seem like a poor indicator for what's going on in the community as most of the communities are there for people to organize and socialize. The mission and roadmap act more as a bat signal / vibe check and what the group actually does arises more naturally.
