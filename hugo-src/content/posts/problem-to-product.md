## The Problem
When I first got my dog I had a problem. It's not one you would have thought of and it's to do with picking up poop. When you have a dog, you most likely have some form of clingy plastic bag wrapped into a roll that you carry around with you to pick up poop. However these bags can be *haaard* to open. They're like the produce bags in the grocery store except maybe harder to open by a factor of 2 or 3. The trick is to get your fingers wet, which isn't a reliable option whether there's a mask in the way or you simply don't want to lick your fingers or can't get your dog to do it for you. If you watch people whipping out these bags you'll undoubtedly notice some struggles. *It's a small but persistent problem for about half of the dog owners I talked to.* While the problem seems small, there are 48 million dog owning households in the US, so the scope is fairly large.

## Modeling
In November of 2020 I decided to build a tool that would solve this problem. Covid-19 and face masks exacerbated the situation and so it seemed about time. My initial idea of a spring actuated rubber tipped mechanism that opened the bags as they came out of the dispenser was a bit overly complicated. I ended up coming up with a much simpler solution, a small but flexible rubber grip that fit to your fingers. Using Fusion 360 and an average human thumb measurement of 49mm I created a design that I thought might fit well into my fingers. I set up my [
Monoprice MP Select Mini 3D Printer V2](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=21711) that I hadn't turned on in the last 2 years. After a bed releveling, a few test prints, and print speed setting tweaks I was in business and was able to create a solid prototype for checking the dimensions and potentially casting in silicone.

After seeing the first print I thought it looked a lot like a wishbone, and so I settled on that as the name going forward. This first design proved a bit small and prototyping took several iterations and a few hours of Fusion 360 youtube tutorials before I got something that fit into my fingers just right several days later.

## Prototyping

Creating a working version would prove a bit more elusive. I would need to cast rubber (silicone in this case) in the shape of the object. Now an experienced maker might have approached this with a bit more forethought. I know casting silicone into silicone is a fools errand as silicone melts silicone and will bind together. However I had read that a good enough release agent would make this possible.

What I ended up with was a goopy mess. Now I had wanted to use a flexible mold because the part being cast has concave shapes that essentially lock two halves of the mold together. To get around this I ended up creating a 5-part pull apart version of the object, held together with tape, that I cast in plaster. After casting I excavated the individual parts.

This actually worked, though the result was not super appealing, it actually worked.

After getting a working version I stopped to reflect on all these shennanigans. I was set on the idea of casting the part, since that's how I had worked with silicone the previous time I had cast something (I had previously made a custom themed Gandalf chocolate for my girlfriend). But this object was just 3d printed, and I could just as easily cut that object out of a box and make a 3d printed mold.
